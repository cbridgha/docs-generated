|===
|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+AutoDecompression+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Specifies whether the HTTP Channel automatically decompresses incoming request body data.+

|+DoNotAllowDuplicateSetCookies+

|string

|+false+

|+Prevents the HTTP Channel from sending multiple Set-Cookie headers with the same name.+

|+MessageSizeLimit+

|long

|+-1+

|+Limits the acceptable size of an incoming message. If a message arrives with a size larger than this value, then an error is returned to the remote client.+

|+NoCacheCookiesControl+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Allows the user to control whether or not the presence of a Set-Cookie header should update the Cache-Control header with a matching no-cache value. This also adds the Expires header.+

|+ThrowIOEForInboundConnections+

|boolean

|

|+Specifies whether the HTTP channel creates an I/O exception when an inbound connection is closed while still in use by the servlet. The default value is set according to the configured servlet feature. Prior to Servlet 4.0, the default value is false; starting with Servlet 4.0, the default value is true.+

|+connectionWindowSize+

|int +
Min: +65535+ +
Max: +2147483647+

|+65535+

|+Specifies the window size in octets for HTTP/2 connection-level flow control. This value can be configured to any size within the range of 65,535 to 2,147,483,647 octets, inclusive. If no value is specified, the default value is 65,535 octets.+

|+decompressionRatioLimit+

|int +
Min: +1+

|+200+

|+Specifies the maximum ratio of decompressed to compressed request body payload. The HTTP channel reads the request body and verifies the ratio as the body decompresses. The channel stops decompression of the request body if the decompression ratio remains above the configured value and the decompressionTolerance is reached.+

|+decompressionTolerance+

|int +
Min: +0+

|+3+

|+Specifies the maximum number of times the HTTP channel tolerates a decompression ratio above the configured ratio, depicted by the decompressionRatioLimit httpOption attribute. If this number reaches, and the next decompression cycle still contains a decompression ratio above the ratio limit, then the HTTP channel stops decompressing the request body.+

|+http2ConnectionIdleTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+0+

|+Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that an HTTP/2 connection will be allowed to remain idle between socket IO operations. If not specified, or set to a value of 0, there is no connection timeout set. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+id+

|string

|

|+A unique configuration ID.+

|+incomingBodyBufferSize+

|int +
Min: +1024+ +
Max: +1048576+

|+32768+

|+Specifies the size of each buffer used when reading the body of an incoming HTTP message.+

|+keepAliveEnabled+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Enables persistent connections (HTTP keepalive). If true, connections are kept alive for reuse by multiple sequential requests and responses. If false, connections are closed after the response is sent.+

|+limitFieldSize+

|int +
Min: +50+ +
Max: +2147483647+

|+32768+

|+Enforces the size limits on various HTTP fields, such as request URLs, or individual header names or values. Enforcing the size limits of these fields guards against possible Denial of Service attacks. An error is returned to the remote client, if a field exceeds the allowed size.+

|+limitNumHeaders+

|int +
Min: +50+ +
Max: +500+

|+500+

|+Limits the number of HTTP headers that can exist in an incoming message. When this limit is exceeded, an error is returned to the remote client.+

|+limitWindowUpdateFrames+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Specifies whether the server waits until half of the HTTP/2 connection-level and stream-level windows are exhausted before it sends WINDOW_UPDATE frames. Valid values are true or false. If no value is specified, the default value is false.+

|+maxConcurrentStreams+

|int

|+100+

|+Specifies the maximum number of streams that an HTTP/2 connection can have active at any given point. Opening streams over the limit, will result on a REFUSED_STREAM (0x7). If not specified, the default value of concurrent streams will be set to 200.+

|+maxFrameSize+

|int +
Min: +16384+ +
Max: +16777215+

|+57344+

|+Specifies the maximum allowed size of a frame payload the server will advertise in the SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE HTTP/2 settings frame. This can be configured to any size within the range of 16,384 to 16,777,215 bytes, inclusive. If not specified, the default is set to 57,344 bytes.+

|+maxHeaderBlockSize+

|long +
Min: +0+

|+512000+

|+Specifies the maximum size in bytes for the header block of individual HTTP2 streams. If this value is exceeded, the connection is closed with an error. Set this parameter to 0 to disable the check.+

|+maxKeepAliveRequests+

|int +
Min: +-1+

|+-1+

|+Maximum number of persistent requests that are allowed on a single HTTP connection if persistent connections are enabled. A value of -1 means unlimited. This option supports low latency or high throughput applications, and SSL connections for use in situations where building up a new connection can be costly.+

|+maxResetFrames+

|int +
Min: +0+

|+100+

|+Specifies the maximum number of reset frames per connection that are allowed during the reset frame window. If this value is exceeded, the connection is closed. Set this parameter to 0 to disable the check.+

|+maxStreamsRefused+

|int +
Min: +0+

|+100+

|+Specifies the maximum number of streams that are refused after the maximum concurrent streams limit is reached. If this value is exceeded, the connection is closed. Set this parameter to 0 to disable the check.+

|+persistTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+30s+

|+Amount of time that a socket will be allowed to remain idle between requests. This setting only applies if persistent connections are enabled. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+readTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time to wait for a read request to complete on a socket after the first read occurs. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+removeServerHeader+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Removes server implementation information from HTTP headers.+

|+resetFramesWindow+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+30s+

|+Specifies the window of time during which reset frames are counted on each connection. Set this parameter to 0 for unlimited time window. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+settingsInitialWindowSize+

|int +
Min: +1+ +
Max: +2147483647+

|+65535+

|+Specifies the initial window size in octets for HTTP/2 stream-level flow control. This value can be configured to any size within the range of 1 to 2,147,483,647 octets, inclusive. If no value is specified, the default value is 65,535 octets.+

|+writeTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time to wait on a socket for each portion of the response data to be transmitted. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+
