|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+accessTokenCacheEnabled+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Specifies whether authenticated subjects that are created by using a propagated access tokens are cached.+

|+accessTokenCacheTimeout+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+5m+

|+Specifies how long an authenticated subject that is created by using a propagated access token is cached. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+accessTokenInLtpaCookie+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Specifies whether the LTPA token includes the access token.+

|+allowCustomCacheKey+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Specifies whether a custom cache key is used to store users in an authentication cache. If this property is set to true and the cache key for a user is not found in the authentication cache, the user will be required to log in again. Set this property to false when you use the jwtSso feature to allow the security subject to be constructed directly from the jwtSso cookie. Set this property to false when you do not use the jwtSso feature to allow the security subject to be constructed directly from the user registry. If the security subject is reconstructed from the user registry, there will be no SSO components in the subject. If your LTPA cookie is used by more than one server, consider setting this property to false. If your application always requires the SSO components to be present in the subject, you must either set this property to true or use the jwtSso feature.+
